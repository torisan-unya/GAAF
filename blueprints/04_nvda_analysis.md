# Blueprint 04: NVDA/NVDU Portfolio Analysis

- **Author**: Torisan Unya
- **Date**: October 27, 2023
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Status**: Design Phase

## 1. Objective

This blueprint details an advanced, agentic framework for the analysis of NVIDIA (NVDA) and its 2x leveraged counterpart (NVDU). The system is designed to generate high-frequency predictions, trading recommendations, and risk assessments by applying the unified Grand Unified Agentic Analysis Framework (GAAF). It places a strong emphasis on capturing market volatility, integrating AI-specific sector news, and achieving self-evolution through a continuous learning loop.

The primary performance targets for this blueprint are:
- **Prediction Accuracy**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) < 0.15% (deviation < 2%).
- **Strategic Stability**: Sharpe Ratio > 4.2.
- **Event-Driven Error Reduction**: Achieve over 76% error reduction during significant market events and earnings announcements.

## 2. GAAF Core Integration: CPC-ANN

The entire workflow is encapsulated within the **Contrastive Predictive Coding - Agentic Neural Network (CPC-ANN)**, the foundational architecture of GAAF. This framework treats all components as nodes in a dynamic, self-optimizing graph.

- **Agentic Neural Network (ANN)**: All tools (`web_search`, `code_execution`), models (DL hybrids, LLMs), and agents are represented as interconnected nodes. This allows for flexible, modular, and scalable analysis pipelines.
- **Collective Predictive Coding (CPC)**: Agents collaboratively work to minimize a collective predictive error (InfoNCE loss per arXiv:1807.03748) by learning robust time-series representations. This process involves decentralized updates to a shared latent space, effectively performing collective Bayesian inference.
- **Self-Evolutionary Loop**: The system employs unlimited `Forward` (execution) and `Backward` (learning) passes. The `reflection_agent` uses natural language gradients to optimize agent roles, connections, and prompts based on prediction errors and output variance. This enables lightweight self-evolution without retraining the base LLM, adapting the system's logic in real-time.

High-volatility conditions (e.g., `vol > std * 1.5`) automatically trigger the formation of specialized agent teams to manage increased complexity and risk.

### Core Pseudo-code Implementation

The following pseudo-code illustrates the CPC-ANN's dynamic team formation and iterative processing loop.

```python
import numpy as np
# from torch import nn # Example for model definitions

class Agent:
    def __init__(self, role, prompt):
        self.role = role
        self.prompt = prompt
        self.connections = []

def form_multi_team(input_vol, roles=['data_agent', 'predict_agent', 'gan_agent', 'drl_agent', 'reflect_agent', 'xai_agent', 'cpc_agent']):
    """Dynamically forms a team of agents based on market volatility."""
    agents = [Agent(role, f"Role: {role}. Process input for NVDA price analysis.") for role in roles]
    # Dynamically connect the prediction agent to all analytical sub-agents
    for agent in agents:
        if agent.role == 'predict_agent':
            agent.connections = [a for a in agents if a != agent]
    # Auto-scale team during high volatility
    if input_vol > np.std(returns) * 1.5:
        agents.append(Agent('vol_agent', "Handle high volatility in NVDA price action."))
    return agents

def forward_pass(agents, data, iterations=10, threshold=0.05):
    """Executes the collaborative analysis and prediction cycle."""
    output = data
    iter_count = 0
    cpc_loss = 1.0
    
    while iter_count < iterations and (np.var(output) > threshold or cpc_loss > 0.05):
        for agent in agents:
            # Agent-specific sub-task execution
            if agent.role == 'gan_agent':
                output = "GAN synthetic data generated: " + str(np.random.normal(np.mean(output), np.std(output), 100_000_000))
            elif agent.role == 'drl_agent':
                output = "DRL optimized action based on state: " + str(output * 1.1)
            elif agent.role == 'xai_agent':
                output = "XAI interpreted: SHAP values for " + str(output)
            elif agent.role == 'reflect_agent':
                output = "Reflected on bias and redundancy: " + str(output)
            elif agent.role == 'cpc_agent':
                # cpc_rep, cpc_loss = cpc_model(data) # Simulate CPC
                output = "CPC representation generated. Loss: " + str(cpc_loss)
            
            # Propagate output through connections
            for conn in agent.connections:
                conn.prompt += f"Input from {agent.role}: {output}"

        variance = np.var(output)
        error = np.mean(np.abs(output - target)) # 'target' is the actual price
        iter_count += 1
    return output, variance, cpc_loss

def backward_pass(agents, output_error, threshold=0.05):
    """Self-evolutionary phase to update agent prompts and roles using natural language gradients."""
    for agent in agents:
        # Generate natural language gradients for self-improvement
        gradient_prompt = (f"Improve role[{agent.role}] to reduce error[{output_error}]. "
                           f"Optimize connections[{agent.connections}]. Update prompt with natural language gradient for self-evolution. "
                           f"CPC external force: Update collective latent space via Langevin dynamics per OpenReview RPPNDX2WLf.")
        # Simulate LLM-based update (LLM parameters are frozen)
        agent.prompt = "LLM simulated update: " + gradient_prompt
    
    # Verify improvement
    new_output, _, _ = forward_pass(agents, data)
    new_error = np.mean(np.abs(new_output - target))
    if new_error <= threshold:
        return agents
    return agents

def scale_test_time(agents, data, serial_iters=10, parallel_trajectories=1):
    """Scales test-time compute by running multiple analysis trajectories."""
    trajectories = []
    for _ in range(parallel_trajectories):
        output, _, _ = forward_pass(agents, data, iterations=serial_iters)
        trajectories.append(output)
    
    scaled_output = np.mean(trajectories)
    # Trigger backward pass if variance across trajectories is high
    if np.var(trajectories) > 0.05:
        backward_pass(agents, np.mean(np.abs(scaled_output - target)))
    return scaled_output

# Invocation in each module:
# vol = calculate_volatility(input_data)
# agents = form_multi_team(vol)
# output, variance, cpc_loss = scale_test_time(agents, module_data, serial_iters=15 if vol > std*1.5 else 10, parallel_trajectories=3 if vol > std*1.5 else 1)
# if variance > 0.05 or error > threshold:
#     agents = backward_pass(agents, error)
```

## 3. Core Methodologies Applied Across Modules

The following advanced techniques are integrated throughout the workflow to ensure state-of-the-art performance.

- **GAN-based Data Augmentation**: A pre-trained Time-Series GAN (TSGAN/WGAN-GP) generates 10^8 synthetic data samples (news snippets, time series). This drastically reduces the need for live tool calls (`web_search`, `browse_page`), limiting them to validation and saving computational resources.
- **Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)**: A hybrid of PPO and MADDPG agents models market volatility and regime shifts. The reward function is `reward = -MAE*1.2 + SharpeRatio`, optimizing for accuracy and risk-adjusted returns.
- **Advanced DL Hybrid Model**: A sophisticated ensemble combines the strengths of xLSTM-TS (for long-term dependencies), GNN (for inter-stock relationships), CNN (for pattern recognition), GBR (for feature interaction), and MTL (for simultaneous prediction of price, volatility, and sentiment).
- **LLM Self-Reflection & Refinement**: A dedicated `reflection_agent` uses a `reflection_prompt` to critically evaluate outputs for bias, misinformation, and redundancy. This loop, limited to 3-6 iterations, has been shown to reduce bias by up to 20% and MAE by 0.2-1.1%. It also incorporates LLM zero-shot time-series forecasting for novel pattern detection.
- **XAI for Interpretability**: SHAP and LIME are applied to all model outputs to provide transparent explanations of feature contributions (e.g., "GPU innovation demand contribution: +2.5%"). This aids debugging and builds trust.
- **Dynamic Query Generation & Throttling**: Queries are dynamically generated using `itertools.product` to cover various regions, industries, and AI-specific factors. `GridSearchCV` optimizes `num_results` and filtering thresholds. During high volatility, thresholds are dynamically raised (e.g., to `std*5.0`) to focus on critical information.
- **Federated Learning**: A `FederatedAvg` model aggregates data from multiple sources (news, sentiment) to enhance privacy, reduce source-specific bias, and improve robustness.
- **Dynamic Lookback Period**: The lookback period for technical analysis is dynamically adjusted based on volatility (e.g., from 14 to 30 days when `vol > std*1.5`), optimized via `GridSearchCV` to improve returns.

## I. Real-Time NVDA/NVDU Analysis Workflow

This section outlines the 8-module process for generating a live forecast and trading recommendation.

### Module 1: Data Ingestion & News Analysis
- **Objective**: Aggregate and process all relevant real-time information with a focus on AI-sector drivers.
- **Methods**:
    - **Multi-Source Ingestion**: Parallel `browse_page` calls to financial news sites (Reuters, CNBC, Bloomberg), and data providers (Yahoo Finance).
    - **Dynamic & Multi-Lingual Querying**: `web_search_with_snippets` with dynamically generated queries covering AI/ML impacts, GPU demand, data center growth, and competitor earnings. Queries are expanded to include English, Japanese, Chinese, and French (`lang:en|ja|zh|fr`).
    - **LLM Sentiment Analysis**: A fine-tuned FinBERT/QLoRA model processes news and X (Twitter) sentiment, with scores weighted by source credibility and engagement.
    - **Federated Learning**: A `FederatedAvg` model aggregates sentiment scores from diverse sources to create a robust, privacy-preserving consensus.

### Module 2: Price Fluctuation Prediction
- **Objective**: Generate the primary price forecast using the advanced hybrid model.
- **Methods**:
    - **Advanced DL Hybrid Integration**: The core prediction is generated by an ensemble of xLSTM-TS, GNN, CNN, and GBR, with an MTL head simultaneously predicting price, volatility, and sentiment.
    - **LLM Zero-Shot Forecasting**: An LLM is prompted to perform zero-shot time-series forecasting on the data, and its output is fused with the DL hybrid prediction to capture novel, text-like patterns.
    - **Monte Carlo Simulation**: 10^8 simulations are run based on historical volatility and current trend data to generate a predictive distribution.

### Module 3: Key Risk Factor Analysis
- **Objective**: Identify and quantify potential risks, including sector-specific and macroeconomic factors.
- **Methods**:
    - **Causal Inference & Feature Selection**: A causal learning model infers the impact of variables, and Lasso regression prunes low-impact features to focus analysis.
    - **Risk-Specific Queries**: Specialized queries focus on identifying potential market shocks, sector rotations (e.g., "AI chip sector rotation"), and competitor news.
    - **LLM Risk Scoring**: FinBERT/QLoRA re-processes snippets to assign risk scores to identified factors.

### Module 4: Trading Recommendation Generation
- **Objective**: Generate actionable theoretical entry/exit points for NVDA and NVDU.
- **Methods**:
    - **DRL-based Actions**: The trained PPO/MADDPG agents provide dynamic action recommendations (buy/sell/hold thresholds) based on the current market observation and detected regime.
    - **Optimized Thresholds**: Recommends adjustment thresholds (e.g., "consider action > 4.5%, execute > 6.5%") based on backtested optimal values. NVDU recommendations are calculated by applying a 2x leverage factor to the NVDA recommendation percentage.

### Module 5: Confidence Level Assessment
- **Objective**: Quantify the confidence in the final forecast across different scenarios.
- **Methods**:
    - **Robust Confidence Intervals**: Calculates a 95% confidence interval, widened by 10% for robustness.
    - **Bootstrap Validation**: 5,000 bootstrap iterations are run to test the stability of the prediction.
    - **Model Agreement**: Confidence is boosted by the R² of an OLS regression of the actual value against the prediction (>0.92 required).

### Module 6: Historical Case Comparison
- **Objective**: Contextualize the current forecast by comparing it to similar past events.
- **Methods**:
    - **Similarity Search**: Identifies the top 10 most similar historical events based on a feature correlation of >0.85.
    - **LLM Contextualization**: The `reflection_agent` analyzes historical comparisons to check for confirmation bias.

### Module 7: Paper Trading Simulation
- **Objective**: Simulate the strategy's performance over the next 60 days.
- **Methods**:
    - **Walk-Forward Simulation**: A walk-forward methodology is used on GAN-generated synthetic future data to evaluate potential performance (MAE, Sharpe Ratio).
    - **DRL-driven Simulation**: The DRL agents simulate actions within the future data, providing a realistic performance outlook.

### Module 8: AI Competitor Simulation
- **Objective**: Simulate the impact of competing AI-related factors on the NVDA forecast.
- **Methods**:
    - **Multivariate Simulation**: A multivariate normal simulation (10^8 samples) models the correlated movements of AI model impacts, GPU demand, data center growth, and gaming trends.
    - **Impact Analysis**: The simulation assesses how shocks in these related areas would affect the NVDA prediction.

## II. Backtesting and Validation Protocol

A rigorous backtesting protocol over the last 20 years (2005-Present) is used to validate the strategy's long-term viability.

- **Walk-Forward Testing**: The primary method, using a 16-year in-sample period for optimization and a 4-year out-of-sample period for testing, rolled forward monthly.
- **Combinatorial Purged Cross-Validation (CP-CV)**: Used to prevent data leakage common in time-series analysis by "purging" training data that is too close to the test set and "embargoing" data immediately after. This provides a more realistic estimate of out-of-sample performance.
- **Regime Shift Detection**: A MARL-LSTM model detects historical regime shifts, allowing for regime-specific backtesting and parameter tuning to ensure the strategy is robust across different market conditions.
- **GAN-Powered Stress Testing**: The GAN generates a massive synthetic dataset (10^8 paths) to stress-test the model against a wide range of never-before-seen market conditions, ensuring robustness against black swan events.
- **Performance Metrics**: The backtest evaluates MAE, R², Sharpe Ratio, max drawdown, and event-specific error reduction. It also calculates the Probability of Backtest Overfitting (PBO) and the Deflated Sharpe Ratio (DSR) to ensure statistical soundness.

## 4. Output Format

The final output is delivered in a structured format, beginning with a summary of key inputs and followed by a detailed table.

**Summary of Inputs:** Monte Carlo inputs, X post count, news dates, related earnings schedules, yield changes, technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Volatility), DRL signals, LLM context scores, CPC Loss.
**XAI Interpretation:** SHAP/LIME-based explanation of key drivers (e.g., "AI innovation demand contribution: +2.5%").
