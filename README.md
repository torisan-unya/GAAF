# Grand Unified Agentic Analysis Framework (GAAF)

## Overview

The **Grand Unified Agentic Analysis Framework (GAAF)** is a next-generation AI financial analysis framework composed of a self-evolving, self-organizing collective of agents.

This framework is not a single, static model, but a living intellectual system that dynamically adapts its structure and strategies in response to the analysis target and market environment. Beginning with the analysis of macroeconomic indicators (PCE, PMI, CPI) and culminating in the analysis of complex, noisy targets like individual stocks (NVDA), it has evolved from a mere "prediction system" into a **"Cognitive and Reasoning Engine"** that internally learns and reasons about the intrinsic meaning of data.

## The Evolutionary Trajectory

The evolution of GAAF was achieved through four major milestones.

1.  **PCE Blueprint: Birth of a "Self-Organizing Team of Experts"**
    *   Established the fundamental structure where multiple AI agents (data collection, forecasting, self-reflection, etc.) collaborate.
    *   The prototype for a self-evaluation and improvement loop via the `reflection_agent` was born.

2.  **PMI Blueprint: Acquisition of "Dynamic Adaptation"**
    *   Gained the ability to detect market volatility and automatically adjust analysis parameters (e.g., lookback periods).
    *   Incorporated synthetic data generation via GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) to balance computational cost with robustness.

3.  **CPI Blueprint: Achieving "Advanced Coordination and Robustness"**
    *   Integrated cutting-edge technologies such as MADDPG (Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient), Federated Learning, and CP-CV (Combinatorial Purged Cross-Validation).
    *   Acquired the ability for agents to coordinate at a higher level, learn from external data sources while preserving privacy, and achieve maximum statistical reliability through advanced validation techniques.

4.  **NVDA Blueprint: The Leap to a "Cognitive and Reasoning Engine"**
    *   Integrated **Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC)**, enabling the AI to autonomously learn "essential representations" (meaning) from time-series data.
    *   Introduced the concept of **Scaling Test-Time Compute**, achieving a meta-cognitive ability to self-adjust the "depth" and "breadth" of its reasoning based on problem difficulty.
    *   This marks the decisive stage where the framework evolved beyond mere numerical prediction into a cross-domain analytical intelligence, showing **the embryonic signs of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)**.

## Core Architecture

GAAF is composed of four hierarchical layers.

*   **Foundation Layer (Core Architecture)**
    *   `Agentic Neural Network (ANN)`: A unified execution substrate that treats all tools, models, and agents as nodes.
    *   `Forward/Backward Pass`: A cycle of collaborative processing among agents and self-evolutionary improvement based on errors.

*   **Cognitive Layer**
    *   `Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC)`: The core engine for self-supervised learning of semantic data representations.
    *   `Scaling Test-Time Compute`: Dynamic allocation of cognitive resources.
    *   `AGI-like QA & Modality Switching`: Dynamic transition from prediction (Modality 1) to semantic Q&A (Modality 2).
    *   `LLM Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasting`: An alternative forecasting path using text patterns.

*   **Execution Layer**
    *   `GAN-DRL Hybrid`: Volatility capture through synthetic data generation and deep reinforcement learning.
    *   `XAI (SHAP/LIME)`: Interpretability of prediction rationale.
    *   `Self-Reflection & Consensus Agents`: Bias detection, self-correction, and consensus building.
    *   `Federated Learning`: Privacy-preserving distributed learning.

*   **Adaptation Layer**
    *   `Dynamic Query Generation`: Dynamic generation of information-gathering queries based on market conditions.
    *   `Dynamic Lookback Periods`: Automatic adjustment of analysis windows based on volatility.
    *   `Domain-Specific Feature Integration`: Automated selection and integration of features specific to the analysis target.

## Blueprints

Concrete implementation examples of this framework are stored in the `/blueprints` directory. Each file is a design document showing how GAAF is configured and applied to a specific analysis target.

*   [`02_pmi_analysis.md`](./blueprints/02_pmi_analysis.md): Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) Analysis
*   [`03_cpi_analysis.md`](./blueprints/03_cpi_analysis.md): Consumer Price Index (CPI) Analysis
*   [`04_nvda_analysis.md`](./blueprints/04_nvda_analysis.md): NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Analysis
*   [`05_nvda_backtest.md`](./blueprints/05_nvda_backtest.md): NVIDIA (NVDA) Backtest

## Future Outlook

GAAF is more than a tool for analyzing specific financial assets; it is a foundational platform for general-purpose analytical intelligence. Future prospects include its application to bonds, forex, commodities, and even non-financial domains such as weather forecasting and supply chain optimization. This framework represents a significant step towards a fully autonomous analytical AGI.
