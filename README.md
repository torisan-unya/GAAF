## Overview

The **Grand Unified Agentic Analysis Framework (GAAF)** provides a suite of ready-to-use, next-generation AI prompts that instantiate a self-evolving, self-organizing collective of agents for financial analysis.

This framework is not a static model but a living intellectual system that dynamically adapts its structure and strategies in response to the analysis target and market environment. The development of GAAF followed a two-phase trajectory: from a foundational prototype to the establishment of a **complete, unified core architecture**.

This core integrates cutting-edge technologies like Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) and the Agentic Neural Network (ANN). This powerful, unified framework has been successfully applied to a diverse range of analytical targets, from key macroeconomic indicators (PCE, Employment, CPI) to complex, high-volatility assets like individual stocks (NVDA). In doing so, it is evolving from a mere "prediction system" into a **"Cognitive and Reasoning Engine"** that internally learns and reasons about the intrinsic meaning of data.

## From Blueprint to Implementation: The Development Trajectory

The development of GAAF was achieved in two distinct phases, moving from conceptual design to full-scale implementation.

1.  **Phase 1: Proof of Concept (The Prototype Prompt)**
    *   Developed the `PCE Analysis Prompt` as a prototype to prove the viability of the GAAF concept.
    *   Established the fundamental structure of collaborating AI agents (data collection, forecasting, self-reflection) and the prototype for a self-evaluation and improvement loop.
    *   This milestone successfully validated the core idea of a "self-organizing team of experts" in a practical, executable prompt.

2.  **Phase 2: The Grand Unification & Full-Scale Implementation**
    *   Building on the prototype's success, this phase involved the **simultaneous integration** of all planned advanced technologies to forge the complete **GAAF Core Architecture**.
    *   This unification brought together CPC for self-supervised learning, the ANN as a unified execution substrate, Scaling Test-Time Compute for dynamic resource allocation, and the GAN-DRL hybrid for volatility capture, among other technologies.
    *   The `Employment Analysis Prompt` represents the **first full-scale implementation** of this unified GAAF core.
    *   Subsequent prompts, such as the CPI and NVDA analyses, demonstrate the successful application and adaptation of this powerful, unified framework to new and distinct analytical challenges, proving its versatility and practical power.

## Core Architecture

GAAF is built upon a unified, hierarchical architecture composed of four layers. This architecture is not just a theory; it is the underlying logic embedded within each prompt.

*   **Foundation Layer (Core Architecture)**
    *   `Agentic Neural Network (ANN)`: A unified execution substrate that treats all tools, models, and agents as nodes.
    *   `Forward/Backward Pass`: A cycle of collaborative processing among agents and self-evolutionary improvement based on errors.

*   **Cognitive Layer**
    *   `Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC)`: The core engine for self-supervised learning of semantic data representations.
    *   `Scaling Test-Time Compute`: Dynamic allocation of cognitive resources.
    *   `AGI-like QA & Modality Switching`: Dynamic transition from prediction (Modality 1) to semantic Q&A (Modality 2).
    *   `LLM Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasting`: An alternative forecasting path using text patterns.

*   **Execution Layer**
    *   `GAN-DRL Hybrid`: Volatility capture through synthetic data generation and deep reinforcement learning.
    *   `XAI (SHAP/LIME)`: Interpretability of prediction rationale.
    *   `Self-Reflection & Consensus Agents`: Bias detection, self-correction, and consensus building.
    *   `Federated Learning`: Privacy-preserving distributed learning.

*   **Adaptation Layer**
    *   `Dynamic Query Generation`: Dynamic generation of information-gathering queries based on market conditions.
    *   `Dynamic Lookback Periods`: Automatic adjustment of analysis windows based on volatility.
    *   `Domain-Specific Feature Integration`: Automated selection and integration of features specific to the analysis target.

## Prompts

Concrete implementations of this framework are stored in the `/prompts/en` directory. Each file is a ready-to-use prompt designed to configure and apply GAAF to a specific analysis target.

*   [`01_pce_analysis.md`](./prompts/en/01_pce_analysis.md): Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Analysis - **The Foundational Prototype Prompt.**
*   [`02_employment_analysis.md`](./prompts/en/02_employment_analysis.md): Employment Statistics Analysis - **First Full-Scale Implementation of the Unified GAAF Core.**
*   [`03_cpi_analysis.md`](./prompts/en/03_cpi_analysis.md): Consumer Price Index (CPI) Analysis - **Application to a Core Inflation Indicator.**
*   [`04_nvda_analysis.md`](./prompts/en/04_nvda_analysis.md): NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Analysis - **Demonstrating Adaptability for High-Volatility Individual Equities.**

## How to Use

1.  Navigate to the `/prompts/en` directory.
2.  Select the prompt that matches your analytical needs.
3.  Copy the entire content of the Markdown file.
4.  Paste it into a chat session with a state-of-the-art Large Language Model (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus).
5.  Let the agentic team begin its work. For best results, use models with advanced reasoning and tool-use capabilities (e.g., code interpreter, web browsing).

## Future Outlook

GAAF is more than a tool for analyzing specific financial assets; it is a foundational platform for general-purpose analytical intelligence. Future prospects include its application to bonds, forex, commodities, and even non-financial domains such as weather forecasting and supply chain optimization. This framework represents a significant step towards a fully autonomous analytical AGI.
